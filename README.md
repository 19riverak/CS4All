# CS4All - Summer Curriculum
## Created by: Jiin Jeong
### Week 1-5: Python
#### Week 1: Introduction to CS
* **What is Python?**: A programming language is a set of instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks. There are many programming languages including Java, C, C++, Ruby, etc. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created in 1991 by a Dutch programmer. The current stable release is version 3.8, so we typically say we are using Python3.
* **REPL**: [REPL](repl.it) is an online-based text editor. It supports many programming languages.
* **Data types**: There are four primitive data types in Python: string (str), integer (int), floating-point numbers (float), and booleans (bool).
..* Strings are sequences of characters. They are in single-quotes ('') and double-quotes (""). For example, "Hello", "123", and "abc."
..* Integers are numeric values without decimals.
..* Floats have decimals.
..* Booleans are True/False.
* **Comment**: To make single-line comments, you use a hashtag (#). Multiline comments are in three double-quotes (""" """)
```python
   # This is a single-line comment
   """ 
     This is a multi-line
     comment that can span over
     multiple lines.
   """
```
